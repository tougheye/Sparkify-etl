# Sparkify-etl
ETL pipeline project for song play analysis using Redshift and S3.

# Introduction
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

The goal of this project is to buld an etl pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights into what songs their users are listening to.

The project uses two datasets stored in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:
Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data

# Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset(opens in a new tab). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.

song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

# Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator(opens in a new tab) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.

log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

# Fact Table
songplays - records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent
# Dimension Tables
users - users in the app
    Columns - user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
songs - songs in music database
    Columns - song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
artists - artists in music database
    Columns - artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
    Columns - start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

Project files are - 
1. create_tables.py - runs the sql_queries from sql_queries.py file to drop and create the table schemas
2. etl.py - runs the copy queries to copy data from S3 buckets to staging tables and insert queries to load data to the Star Schema tables from sql_queries.py file
3. sql_queries.py - has the sql queries to create, copy and insert data in each stage of etl process
4. dwh.cfg - contains links and credentials that are called using configparser and psycopg2.

   
I first started with writing the codes in sql_queries.py file and calling it from create_tables.py file. I then created our Redshift cluster and necessary AWS ifrastructure (i.e. IAM role)

the project files are 

I then ran queries to copy data from S3 buckets to the staging tables. For some reason, my code was having trouble copying the staging_songs table using Python script even though stl_load_errors table in Redshift did not show any error. Finally, I had to initiate that copy command directly from the query editor with TRANCATECOLUMNS, BLANKSASNULL, and EMPTYASNULL. However, this was only when I tried to copy the entire SONG_DATA bucket, when I loaded a single folder "s3://udacity-dend/song_data/A/A/B/" my script was able to copy the staging_songs table fine.

I then ran the insert queries to laod the Fact and dimension tables. Below are some screenshots of the test queries I ran to quality check -
